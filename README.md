# Rock-Paper-Scissor

Welcome to the Rock Paper Scissors game! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game using Python and the Tkinter library.

Features:
Play against the computer
Simple and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI)
Displays the result of each round
Keeps track of the score 

Usage
Click on one of the buttons (Rock, Paper, or Scissors) to make your choice.
The computer will randomly select its choice.
The result of the round (win, lose, or draw) will be displayed.
The score will be updated after each round.

Learning Experience
While working on this project, I learned how to use the Tkinter library to create a GUI in Python. This involved:

Designing the game layout
Handling user inputs through button clicks
Implementing game logic to determine the winner
Updating the GUI based on game state
